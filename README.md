# 💼 Experience

## iGaming — Data Scientist (09/2022 — 12/2023)
- Data analysis & research: conducted deep analysis of user traffic, identified behavioral patterns and anomalies, and validated hypotheses using large datasets
- Anomaly-detection ML model: developed a machine-learning model that generated an anomaly score to automatically flag suspicious behavior. The solution strengthened anti-fraud controls and reduced fraudulent traffic by 35%  
- Real-time monitoring & alerts: built Python-based monitoring pipelines and alerting systems to detect unusual activity spikes and automatically route suspicious cases for additional manual review.  
- BI dashboards & reporting: created interactive Power BI dashboards that visualized key performance metrics and improved data-driven decision-making. This partially automated the workflow of affiliate managers, making it more transparent and data-driven, and sped up their operational processes by 30%.
- Partner payout validation: implemented a transparent payout recalculation and verification process, increasing the accuracy of partner payments and reducing support-related tasks to zero thanks to fully reliable payout calculations
- Partner collaboration & negotiations: negotiated with major partners to establish profitable collaborations, secured pricing terms favorable for the company, and managed the entire process end-to-end.

## 🏦 T-Bank — Business Analyst (01/2024 — Present)

### Agent Channel Team, T-Investments (01/2024 — 08/2024)

- Product & stakeholder management: built a fully transparent product process for all stakeholders, launched recurring cross-team project syncs, collected feedback, and aligned requirements to accelerate decision-making.
- Strategic negotiations with family offices: led end-to-end negotiations with major family offices and secured mutually beneficial terms that enabled them to switch brokers and migrate assets to our platform.
- AUM growth: contributed directly to a net $270M AUM increase, driven by successful onboarding of high-value partner clients.
- Marketing infrastructure launch: designed and launched the full architecture for running marketing campaigns in the partner channel — built from scratch due to the absence of any prior backend or operational framework.
- Large-scale partner acquisition campaign: initiated and executed a major marketing campaign that leveraged a partner’s large user base, significantly boosting conversion and accelerating asset inflows.

  
### Online Auto Loans (08/2024 — Present)

#### **Partner Services Integration Platform** 

Led the end-to-end development of a new platform that enabled the bank to integrate and sell partner services (insurance, driver assistance) directly in the online auto-loan flow — from concept and system design to full-scale launch and monetization.


- Built the full product and technical architecture from scratch, including service cost inclusion into the loan body, automated charging, commission processing, revenue recognition, and complete accounting & reconciliation flows.

- Drove transparent cross-functional delivery: aligned 15+ teams (legal, finance, risk, accounting, design, analytics, development and others), coordinated requirements, secured development resources, and managed the full product lifecycle.

- Performed deep business and system analysis, designed CJMs and integration logic, prepared BRDs/FRDs/API specs, and negotiated data-exchange agreements and commission terms with external partners.

- Launched A/B tests, set up analytics for funnel tracking, attach-rate monitoring and partner-economics evaluation; iterated and scaled the platform to multiple partners.

- Monetization impact: reduced client rates via partner commissions (TR +2.7 p.p.), achieved +$6M NPV/year, and enabled a reusable infrastructure that became a foundation for future partner integrations.

#### *Bringing in-salon auto loans fully online*

Led the transformation of the traditional in-salon auto-loan process — previously fully manual and paper-based — into a complete digital flow inside the bank’s online and mobile channels.
Designed the full end-to-end product model enabling customers to apply for a specific car directly online, receive scoring decisions, see personalized rates and terms, and digitally sign all documents before visiting the dealership.

- Built the technical architecture to integrate hundreds of dealerships and thousands of car offers, including partner onboarding flows, real-time data exchange, subsidy & special-program eligibility checks, and instant scoring decision logic.

- Defined product requirements, aligned business logic, coordinated legal/finance/risk/compliance/design/analytics/engineering teams, and ensured transparent cross-team delivery across a long, multi-phase project.

- Conducted deep system analysis and worked closely with architects and engineering leads to migrate legacy in-salon workflows into scalable digital services, resolving complex edge cases around scoring, subsidies, dealer commissions, and contract signing.

- Designed and validated the customer journey (CJM), online funnel, mobile-bank screens, and document-signing mechanics; launched iterative A/B tests to refine conversion and operational efficiency.

- Negotiated dealer integrations, ensured process standardization, and built the operational ecosystem to support high scale (hundreds of partner dealerships).

- Business impact: unlocked a fully digital in-salon loan process, dramatically reducing manual operations and enabling +$14M NPV/year through higher conversion, lower operational costs, and improved subsidy utilization.
