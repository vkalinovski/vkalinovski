## 💼 Experience

### 🎲 iGaming — Traffic Analyst (09/2022 — 12/2023)
- Data analysis & research: conducted deep analysis of user traffic, identified behavioral patterns and anomalies, and validated hypotheses using large datasets
- Anomaly-detection ML model: developed a machine-learning model that generated an anomaly score to automatically flag suspicious behavior. The solution strengthened anti-fraud controls and reduced fraudulent traffic by 35%  
- Real-time monitoring & alerts: built Python-based monitoring pipelines and alerting systems to detect unusual activity spikes and automatically route suspicious cases for additional manual review.  
- BI dashboards & reporting: created interactive Power BI dashboards that visualized key performance metrics and improved data-driven decision-making. This partially automated the workflow of affiliate managers, making it more transparent and data-driven, and sped up their operational processes by 30%.
- Partner payout validation: implemented a transparent payout recalculation and verification process, increasing the accuracy of partner payments and reducing support-related tasks to zero thanks to fully reliable payout calculations
- Partner collaboration & negotiations: negotiated with major partners to establish profitable collaborations, secured pricing terms favorable for the company, and managed the entire process end-to-end.

### 🏦 T-Bank — Business Analyst (01/2024 — Present)

#### Agent Channel Team, T-Investments (01/2024 — 08/2024)

- Product & stakeholder management: built a fully transparent product process for all stakeholders, launched recurring cross-team project syncs, collected feedback, and aligned requirements to accelerate decision-making.
- Strategic negotiations with family offices: led end-to-end negotiations with major family offices and secured mutually beneficial terms that enabled them to switch brokers and migrate assets to our platform.
- AUM growth: contributed directly to a net $270M AUM increase, driven by successful onboarding of high-value partner clients.
- Marketing infrastructure launch: designed and launched the full architecture for running marketing campaigns in the partner channel — built from scratch due to the absence of any prior backend or operational framework.
- Large-scale partner acquisition campaign: initiated and executed a major marketing campaign that leveraged a partner’s large user base, significantly boosting conversion and accelerating asset inflows.

  
#### Online Auto Loans (08/2024 — Present)

**Partner Services Integration Platform** 

Led the end-to-end development of a new platform that enabled the bank to integrate and sell partner services (insurance, driver assistance) directly in the online auto-loan flow — from concept and system design to full-scale launch and monetization.


- Built the full product and technical architecture from scratch, including service cost inclusion into the loan body, automated charging, commission processing, revenue recognition, and complete accounting & reconciliation flows.

- Drove transparent cross-functional delivery: aligned 10+ teams (legal, finance, risk, accounting, mobile bank, analytics, engineering), coordinated requirements, secured development resources, and managed the full product lifecycle.

- Performed deep business and system analysis, designed CJMs and integration logic, prepared BRDs/FRDs/API specs, and negotiated data-exchange agreements and commission terms with external partners.

- Launched A/B tests, set up analytics for funnel tracking, attach-rate monitoring and partner-economics evaluation; iterated and scaled the platform to multiple partners.

- Monetization impact: reduced client rates via partner commissions (TR +4 p.p.), achieved +23 NPV/year, and enabled a reusable infrastructure that became a foundation for future partner integrations.
